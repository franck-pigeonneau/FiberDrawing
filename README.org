* Description of the program

This program determines the profil of the fiber heating in the drawing furnage. A lubrication model is used in steady-state regime. The heating of the fiber is taken into account. 

The program is decomposed in various steps:
    
1. Input of physical and numerical parameters
2. Computation of the radiative flux and the liner temperature
3. Determination of a, T, qa, Biconv
4. Heating rate of the fiber
5. Plotting
6. Save of the results

The model is described in detail in ref. [1].

To easy change the glass properties, the glass liner chatacteristics, the working conditions and numerical parameters are gathered in csv files. Here, these files are given for
our own applications.
